 - barcode2isbn should support more barcode/isbn formats
  - do proper checking where possible
 - make sure whitespace conforms to python norms
 - properly comment functions
 - extend xml parsing
 - make author names unique
 - add foreign key constraints to db
 - deal with old books (The Prince, published in 1515 raises a warning when inserted, and puts year as 0000)
 - use some of the information given by the API that is currently ignored
 - build a django front-end for viewing the data held
	- particularly use this for front covers!
 - Add image locations to the database, rather than just leave stranded on disk
 - Check/allow selection of booktype (paperback, hardback etc)
 - Deal with barcodes that when scanned gives old and new style barcode
 - Deal with someone pressing "enter" rather than giving any content for ISBN entry
